## Or the rise of the Nana Corps

The school year has begun for begun for my family. For us, that means “hybrid learning”- two days a week at school and three days a week at home for my 1st and 2nd grader, with half the class (a “cohort”)  in person Monday/Tuesday and half in person Thursday/Friday. I’m happy with this arrangement- I think it provides the needed socialization for my kids while providing a good firewall against rapid disease spread. However, the teachers are primarily dealing with the in person “cohort”, a LOT of the at home learning falls on the family. So how are we coping with distance learning.

## Set the objective
I was confident by early July that we would not being going back to business as usual for school, so my wife and I were able to get a head start on our planning. We identified 4 primary objectives for our distance learning experience.

1)	Ensure the kids get a high-quality education.
2)	Enable the parents to continue their careers.
3)	Improve the kids socialization.
4)	Keep everyone in the family sane.

I will say that his is the most formal articulation I have gotten to for these objectives, they were more an understanding built up over hours of discussion about the school situation, how we’d deal with it, and how angry we are at the illogic of opening bars before schools (but that’s another post.)
We pretty quickly realized that there was no way to achieve our objectives with just two parents. Even though I work from home, I think the COVID19 crisis has pretty well demonstrated that working from home and homeschooling are mutually incompatible. We needed support. We needed grandparents.

## Building the team- Bring in the Grandmas! (and Pas)

My wife and I are blessed to have loving, supportive parents. We are also fortunate that they love and miss their grandchildren enough to help us multiple days a week with their education. There is just one catch- due to distance and health concerns, they can’t be physically present with their grandchildren. This was going to be distance grandparenting all the way through.
