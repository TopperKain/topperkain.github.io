Topper Kain (that's me) writes code, deploys infrastructure, leads teams, coaches junior engineers, teaches pre-schoolers to ski, wrangles his own children, fixes broken toys, does amatuer plumbing/carpentery/masonary, cooks epic dinners, and sometimes writes things.

Topper's day job is at Microsoft, in the [Consulting Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msservices) area. That means he helps other organizations solve their big problems with technology.

All content, opinions, success, and mistakes on this site are his own. Tomorrow will be better than today because we will make it that way.
