Topper Kain (that's me) writes code, deploys infrastructure, leads teams, coaches junior engineers, teaches pre-schoolers to ski, wrangles his own children, fixes broken toys, does amatuer plumbing/carpentery/masonary, cooks epic dinners, and sometimes writes things.

Topper's day job is at Microsoft, in the [Consulting Services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msservices) area. That mean's he helps other organizations solve their big problems.

All content, opinions, success, and mistakes on this site are his own.
